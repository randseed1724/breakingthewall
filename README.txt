Breaking the Wall

Breaking the Wall is a exiting 2 players video-game where one player have to break the wall and the other player has to build it. What makes it fun is the competition between who does is faster, who is able to take advantage of the powers and in the worst case who is not able to skip an obstacle that makes you waste time.  The player who is able to finish his tasks first wins.


Call a friend and choose your character. Depending on your selection you will have to build or destroy the wall. Accomplish your task and win!
